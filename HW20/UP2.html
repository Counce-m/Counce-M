      <h1 class=center> User Research Plan </h1>
      
      <p>Objective: Understand areas of improvement in the market space while crafting solutions to utilize in the UX of our app.<br/> <br/>  Research Methodology: Gather research from potential users through the techniques of surveys and interviews while tracking the answers and identifying themes and differences in the given answers.
        
      <h3 class=center> Results </h3>
      <p>During the survey and user interviews, we discovered that most individuals find it difficult to access local events in their community due to lack of resources.  <br />  <br /> Therefore, individuals who seek engagement in their community and seek to try new events within reach will greatly benefit from our app. We can assist these desires and needs with our app that coordinates and allows for users to create new events in the community</p>

      <h3> Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>During our competitor analysis we were able to analyze other competitors and identify strengths and pain points that users have found when navigating their site. From there we were able to consider the opportunities of the user’s feedback for features and layout of the app. </p>
      
      <h4> Clickable Prototype </h4>
      
      <p>During our design process and iterations from our sketches of low fidelity to high-fidelity. We were able to create a user test plan to demonstrate the app's functionality and usability and how to determine ease of navigation and usage from users. In conclusion, we were able to develop a clear objective based on our initial collective ideas and utilizing the design process to map everything out.<p>
